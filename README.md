# About me
Hi,

I'm Raquel Valdez and I've been Strategic Project Management since 2015 and I've been into the project management world for more than 10 years.

I will be able to give you the best recommendations in order to delivery the maximum value to your clients, through control and monotoring boards.

The kind of following that I use is desingned so the people involved is comfortable and makes their aproach to the project very easy. You don't need to worry about the tools for the project management, we just need the communication ones (messenger, slack, whatsapp, telegram, etc.).
I've been working in technology, market research, improvement processes projects with tools as trello, notion, excel as the simples or monday or asana, so you could have this service in any of them.
